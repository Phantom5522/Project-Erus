### Options

**Dividers** — A horizontal line is drawn between each hierarchy item.

**Object Icons** — If an [icon is assigned to an object](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssigningIcons.html), draw the icon in the hierarchy.

**Right Gutter** — If other plugins draw on the right of the hierarchy window, use this setting to add spacing.
